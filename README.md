# Notepad--
A simple light text editor.
Notepadqq was my choice editor. Unfortunately it doesn't maintain anymore. I tried to help but there was old PRs and plenty of unanswered issues. The project was a mix of C++/Qt/Javascript/HTML,CSS,Python...
It is a while I didn't code in C++ and my knowledge of Qt is a little. All that said this is a **toy** project, at least for a while. For now I just release for Linux which has Qt6 installed (dynamic compile).
Any contribution is welcome.

In a world without walls and fences, who needs **windows** and **gates**?
